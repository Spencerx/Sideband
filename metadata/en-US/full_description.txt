Sideband allows you to communicate with other people or LXMF-compatible systems over Reticulum networks using LoRa, Packet Radio, WiFi, I2P, or anything else Reticulum supports.

It is completely free, end-to-end encrypted, permission-less, anonymous and infrastructure-less. Sideband uses the peer-to-peer and distributed messaging system LXMF. There is no sign-up, no service providers, no "end-user license agreements", no data theft and no surveillance. You own the system.

Sideband also supports many useful and interesting functions, such as:

<ul>
<li>Secure and direct P2P telemetry and location sharing. No third parties or servers ever have your data.</li>
<li>Situation display on both online and locally stored offline maps.</li>
<li>Geospatial awareness calculations.</li>
<li>Exchanging messages through encrypted QR-codes on paper, or through messages embedded directly in lxm:// links.</li>
<li>Remote command and request functions, such as ping, signal reports and echo.</li>
<li>Remote telemetry querying, with strong, secure and cryptographically robust authentication and control.</li>
</ul>
